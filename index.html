                                <br>
                                Hey, <br>
                                I'm Ritwik Sharma, a third year Computer Science Engineering student pursuing my bachelors from UPES dehradun<br>
                                I am currently living at Dehradun, India. <br><br>
                                
                                I started actual coding on coming to college. (Well if you consider coding as writing loops and not knowing about arrays, <br> 
                                then Iâ€™m afraid my claim is wrong). I did have to spend a huge, huge lot of time programming to get to this level.<br><br>
                                
                                I always had great interest in Web development so I learned it on my own.<br>
                                Internet helped me a lot in learning HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, Bootstrap, etc.<br><br>
                                
                                I like to work on Open source and I am always eager for new ideas and opportunities to work on, <br>
                                I like to code and I try my best to improve my coding skills whenever I can.<br>
                                As in a world full of great programmers I am a small fraction.<br><br>
                         
                                In my first year of college I was a CSI core committee member and I enjoyed working as an event <br>
                                organizer and successfully orgainzed two technical events at CSI national fest YUGMUK.<br>
                                In my second year I moved more towards improving myself in coding and other academic stuffs<br>
                                at the mid of second year I started working on web development and By the end of 4th sem<br>
                                I ended up having a great interest in Open source development <br><br>
                            
                                Recently I interned at Hackr.io (work from Home), It was a great experience and I learned a lot.<br><br>
                                
                                Looking forward to be Happy :)
